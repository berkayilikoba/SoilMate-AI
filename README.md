# Soilmate AI 
### AI-Powered Smart Soil Analysis & Regional Plant Care Management System

**Soilmate AI** is an advanced agricultural forecasting and risk management ecosystem built on **Huawei Cloud** and the **MindSpore** framework. Optimized for the 7 geographical regions of Turkey, the project combines deep learning models with cloud-based IoT data to generate strategic decisions for sustainable agriculture.

## Technical Architecture & Workflow

The project features an end-to-end pipeline designed to manage agricultural diversity and varying climatic conditions across different regions:

* **Regional Model Training (ModelArts & MindSpore):** Turkey is segmented into 7 distinct geographical regions. Independent Genetic and NDVI models have been trained using region-specific datasets to account for micro-climates.
* **Model Storage & Management (OBS):** Specialized model weights for each region are categorized and stored on Huawei OBS (Object Storage Service) for high availability and seamless retrieval.
* **Data Processing & IoT:** Real-time environmental data (Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall) is ingested from field sensors through the Huawei Cloud IoT DA platform.



* **Intelligent Forecasting:** Utilizing historical data and NDVI analysis, the system generates high-precision forecasts for temperature, humidity, and rainfall on 1-month and 3-month scales.
* **Risk Scoring & Recommendation Engine:** Forecast results are converted into dynamic, region-specific risk scores, providing users with actionable agricultural advice.
* **Visualization (ECS & Streamlit):** This entire architecture is visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard hosted on a Huawei ECS (Elastic Cloud Server) instance.

## Key Features

* **Geographical Segmentation:** 7 distinct model architectures tailored to regional micro-climates.
* **NDVI-Based Analysis:** AI-driven monitoring of plant health and vegetation indices.
* **Long-Term Forecasting:** Accurate climate projections for 1-month and 3-month periods.
* **Dynamic Risk Management:** Real-time reporting of risks such as drought, frost, or excessive rainfall.
* **Smart Recommendations:** Strategic planting and maintenance advice based on predictive analytics.
